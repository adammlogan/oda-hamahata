Magma scripts related to the computations in the paper "Rings of Hilbert
modular forms, computations on Hilbert modular surfaces, and the
Oda-Hamahata conjecture"

In general, for each case of the conjecture considered in the paper, there
is one file that shows how the ring of modular forms was computed using
the software (and, in most cases, the Atkin-Lehner involutions), one file
that does the work of reducing it to a K3 surface that is close to the
desired Kummer surface, and one that matches that K3 surface with one
coming from the Kummer surface.  These are labeled

d*-n*.mag (constructing the ring)
d*-n*-work.mag (reducing the surface)
match-d*-n*.mag (connecting it with the Kummer surface).

Sometimes an additional word in the name expresses some special circumstance
regarding the given example.  In cases where we are not able to verify the
conjecture there is no match file.

In addition there are a few auxiliary files:

k3pic.mag     general computations with K3 surfaces and their Picard lattices
blowup.mag    functions to work with a blowup, especially of a surface at an A_i point (i < 5)
interp.mag    functions for interpolating polynomials and rational numbers
project.mag   functions for finding the images of projections and of more general maps
all_kum_fib.mag script that sets up the elliptic fibrations on the Kummer of E x E' (originally part of a project with Jared Weinstein, arXiv:2211.11149)

Unfortunately much of the code is more complicated than it should be, with
various linear system calculations spelled out rather than relegated to
functions, because bugs in some versions of Magma prevent the general
functions from working in all cases.
